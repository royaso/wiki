himym 

I watched HIMYM an hour ago.

I was warmed not to watch it.

but there is times when something happened and you doesn't get a damn shit about it, and there is times when nothing important or sad happened and you just do it, no even single tiny reason. 

after the ending, I didn't shed a tear or have some other strong feelings.

I didnt' feel what the feel  is .

"she is not even in the group picture"
