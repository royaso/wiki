According to Spreeder, a lot of us have trouble reading quickly because we can only read as fast as our “inner voice” can. 

我们看书慢是因为我们默读，所以受限于默读的速度

Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are helpful for many tasks, but they are not good for all tasks. I have long felt that most computers today are not powered by electricity.  They instead seem to be powered by the "pumping" motion of the mouse! 

图形界面是不错，但不是所有场合都适用。我一直觉得现在大多数电脑不是电源驱动的，而是鼠标来回移动和点击产生的动能来驱动的！

*哈哈哈，笑死，老外真幽默啊.我也想到自己唯一可以比别人牛的地方在于，如果我现在鼠标挂了，我还可以活的好好的，而某些人估计连关机都不知道怎么办了。呵呵.生活没多少乐趣，要懂得自己找乐子*
